It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural paradigm, which encourages concern separation and code organisation.Laravel also includes a sophisticated ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) called Eloquent, a configurable routing system, automated testing capabilities, built-in login and authorisation systems, and caching, queuing, and job scheduling support.
