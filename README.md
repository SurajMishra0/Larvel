# Larvel #

Laravel is a well-known open-source PHP framework for creating online apps and websites.Laravel makes development easier by offering a simple and expressive syntax, a modular framework, and built-in capabilities for tasks like as routing, database administration, and caching. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural paradigm, which encourages concern separation and code organisation.Laravel also includes a sophisticated ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) called Eloquent, a configurable routing system, automated testing capabilities, built-in login and authorisation systems, and caching, queuing, and job scheduling support. It also has a thriving ecosystem with a diverse set of community-driven packages and extensions.
